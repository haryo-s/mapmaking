TO QA / TO UPLOAD - 

Sound Notes:
CDN LINK similar to how we handle images
1 hr ambient loop is 2gb and a large image is?? 
file size max limit: ?
no 1hr loops
our tool can handle…responsible for paying for users storage (part of upgrade plan only?)
hour loops OK for us on
Sound music complaints - users shouldn’t be able to upload their own imo DMCA
piracy of music problem

we should have a generic library sounds
we have to put the sound somewhere so it can be transmitted to the people who are listening it
loaded to CDN (?) 
we don’t care about storage costs at all !!  users can upload sound limits up to a limit 
most of our objects will be spriteless emitters or radio? (some of them, fireplace) 
volume slider 
loops or not
place object that has a firework sound
place by trophy
jaden and matt are in range but the rest aren’t
they will hear it, they will hear it once and it will stop. if they refresh the page they will hear it, but if they revisit the page or stay there once and it will not loop. remove the sound property of the object. 
“play this sound only once” cases 
bushes rustle sound
if you get close to it it will make the coffee animation go and the sound happen 
it moves across the map 
object sounds that will have on interaction on activation
all looped sounds
