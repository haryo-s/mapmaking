Hello! We are excited to inform you that you have made it through the first round of the hiring process at Gather. The overall process looks like:

1. Set yourself apart from hundreds of applicants [done!]
2. Complete a "challenge" to give us a bite-sized sense of what you can do
3. Come in for some interviews with the team

We'd like to see what you do with our challenge, please look at this page for more information.

Spend as much or as little time as you think is necessary, and have fun with this! We are excited to see what you have to show us, and expect to hear from you by the end of the week (March 26th), if you would like to be considered for the position.

Best,
Mark
