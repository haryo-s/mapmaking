was sent with the submission:

THEME: Garden Shed.

There are only a few items for a large room, so I focused on making the left side look comfortable (I added a few assets outside of the small, standard, and large to achieve that). I also noticed a cute grass tile in one of the reference images you attached, so I replicated it to the best of my ability and added a few variations to make the ground seem less empty and for me to see how my work would match up with some of the existing assets in Gather. I hope that is okay. If it is not please let me know, I can most definitely re-submit without the extra tiles or the grass from your game.
