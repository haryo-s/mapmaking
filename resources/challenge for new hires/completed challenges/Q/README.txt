Hi! Finished with the art challenge! Instead of making just a few objects and tiles, I wanted to take full advantage of this time, so I made lots of sprites for a themed room. I also made a few other objects that are used often in Gather like the podium, different types of boards, and rugs for private spaces. You could say the theme is dark/magical mixed with dungeon. Not really sure what to call it, lol. The files I'm returning to you are three pngs- first is the walls and floor tilesheet, next is all the objects and furniture, and lastly an example of everything staged together. I wanted to test them out in Gather so I familiarized myself with the map editor. I could add the single objects, but I couldn't figure out how to add the tilesheet for wall and floor tiles. You said in the challenge description that you use Tiled, and I have used it before for the Unity game engine. To get the maps imported I used "Tiled to Unity." One last thing I wanna let you know is that I also make games, and I noticed that there are mini-games in Gather too, so maybe we could chat another time about that. Over the past few years I've remade tons of small games to learn programming, but never published anything cause they were just for fun. Games like breakout, pong, 2d sidescrollers, ect. The Unity web player exists, so maybe that would work with Gather? Well I hope you all like sprites, and I look forward to hearing from you soon!
